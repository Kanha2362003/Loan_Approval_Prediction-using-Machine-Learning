# Loan_Approval_Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant information and financial details. It uses supervised learning techniques to help automate the loan approval process and assist financial institutions in making faster, data-driven decisions.
✅ Key Features
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand important patterns and correlations.

Training multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Making predictions on new/unseen applicant data.

📊 Dataset
The dataset typically includes information such as:

Applicant’s income

Loan amount requested

Credit history

Marital status

Employment status

Gender 

Education level

Dependents

And other relevant demographic and financial features.

🚀 Goal
The goal is to build an accurate, interpretable, and deployable model that can assist banks and financial institutions in minimizing loan default risks and streamlining the approval workflow.

⚙️ Technologies Used
