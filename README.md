# Loan_Approval_Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant information and financial details. It uses supervised learning techniques to help automate the loan approval process and assist financial institutions in making faster, data-driven decisions.
